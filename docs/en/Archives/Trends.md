# Working with Trends (Runtime)

In Runtime mode, the "Trends" tab is used to view graphs of parameters stored in the archive.

### Trend Selection
The selection window consists of two tabs:
1.  **Groups:** Displays previously saved sets of trends for quick access.
2.  **Archives:** Allows searching for parameters and creating new graphs.

### Series Configuration
A series is a separate line on the graph. For each series, you can configure:
* Line color and thickness.
* Visibility and name.
* Path to the data archive.
* Presence of point markers.
* Minimum and maximum display range.

### Display Control
After plotting the graph, the user can:
* Set a precise display period (start/end date and time).
* Select a preset time interval.
* Analyze parameter behavior over various time segments.
* The graph automatically rebuilds when the period changes.
